Project Description: VRCafe
Objective: VRCafe is a virtual reality experience created for Google Cardboard that invites players to a cozy cafe environment. In this setting, they are attended by a virtual barista who actively listens to their problems and responds in a warm, engaging manner, fostering a feeling of relaxation and connection.

Technical Instructions:
Hardware Requirements:

Device: Any compatible smartphone with Google Cardboard support.
VR Headset: Google Cardboard or any similar viewer.
Input: Gaze-based interaction and/or a single-button input supported by Cardboard for initiating conversations or interacting with items.
Viewable in VR: The scene is fully designed for VR compatibility, utilizing gaze-based selection to allow hands-free interaction. Players can look at specific items or the barista to engage or prompt actions.

Character & Interaction:

Virtual Character: The cafeâ€™s barista, an animated, interactive character, will greet players upon entry.
Animations: The barista has fluid, lifelike animations, including gestures, subtle expressions, and body language adjustments to enhance immersion.
Response to Player Actions: The barista reacts to player interactions (e.g., looking at specific items or initiating conversation) by acknowledging them with tailored responses, offering insights, or even posing questions to simulate authentic human interaction.
